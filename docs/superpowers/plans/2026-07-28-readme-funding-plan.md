### Workflow Summary

| Workflow       | Frequency / Trigger                 | Function                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checker.yml`  | Daily at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST)      | Scans eBalbharati Archives, builds upload queue with 1-hour IST intervals, and creates external cron jobs on cron-job.org.                     |
| `uploader.yml` | Dynamic (repository_dispatch)       | Downloads single PDF issue, renders 100% quality cover thumbnail, verifies SHA-256 integrity, uploads to Telegram Channel, and cleans state.  |
| `bot.yml`      | Every minute (via cron-job.org trigger) | Polls Telegram for owner management commands (`/status`, `/queue`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/history`).                                            |

| `TELEGRAM_OWNER_CHAT_ID` | Your numeric personal Telegram User ID                                                          |

## 🤖 Telegram Bot Commands

| Command    | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/status`  | Displays operational state, last uploaded issue, and queue size. |
| `/queue`   | Displays full pending upload queue with IST schedule.          |
| `/last`    | Shows detailed metadata of the last published issue.            |
| `/history` | Displays the last 30 entries from `upload_history.md`.           |
| `/pause`   | Pauses automatic issue detection and upload execution.          |
| `/resume`  | Resumes operations, re-enables schedule, and uploads overdue issues. |
| `/help`    | Lists all available commands and system information.            |

---

## 🛠️ Error Recovery

If a network or Telegram API error occurs during publication:
1. The bot dispatches a complete error log & traceback directly to your private chat.
2. Resolve the underlying issue or secret configuration.
3. Send `/resume` to your Telegram bot. The system will automatically recalculate overdue uploads, re-trigger workflow dispatches, and re-create any missing cron jobs.
